 <h3>Here's information about Michael's life:</h3>
 
 

  <p style="text-align: center;">Michael David Stevens is an American educator, public speaker, comedian, entertainer, editor,
  and internet celebrity, best known for creating and hosting the popular education YouTube channel Vsauce.</p>
 

<br>
<p>Stevens was born on January 23, 1986, in Kansas City, Missouri. His mother worked as a teaching assistant, while his
father was a chemical engineer. The family relocated to Stilwell, Kansas, in 1991. Stevens graduated from Blue Valley
High School, where he developed a comedic personality, as well as a passion for knowledge, participating in informative
speech and drama club programs. He then graduated from the University of Chicago with a bachelor's degree in
psychology and English literature.</p>
<br>
 <p>Stevens launched the Vsauce channel in 2010.Initially, it featured many contributors, with a heavy focus on video
 game culture. Several distinct series emerged, many of which were hosted by Stevens, including V-LIST (video
 game-related lists), IMG (featuring viral images), DONG (Do Online Now, Guys, showcasing various online games and tools)
 and LÃœT (showing nerdy and interesting products available online). He developed a catchphrase by introducing his videos
 with "Hey, Vsauce. Michael here".</p>
<br>
 <p>Stevens moved to London, England in 2012. In 2016, he married his wife, Marnie, moved back to the United States and
